This is actually kinda fun trying to do this manually.
I can see a game here of some kind.

    You start out with simple items... Dagger, Leather, no jewelry and you have to fight things by choosing your loadout before the fight.
first fight is fairly easy, not really any options. but you get rewarded for using less inventory space in the fight.

    For example, you have a dagger and leather armor, but can win without the leather armor. If you choose to use the armor, 
you will still get the fight'S rewards (xp, base gold, items, etc) but for every skill cost below the 'average cost' you will gain extra
skill points.

    I would need to make it enjoyable, but not overly complicated for the average player to play through while still being
a little challenging. But hide certain rewards, or restrict certain items and abilities to efficiency levels, that will allow
hardcore players who want to study and optimize their loadouts to have something to grind for.
